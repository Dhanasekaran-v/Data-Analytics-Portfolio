# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Using Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes patient health data using Power BI to identify patterns and risk factors associated with heart disease.

The dataset contains 1000+ patient records including medical attributes such as age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and diagnosis outcome.

Data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, and DAX measures were created to generate meaningful insights. The final dashboard enables interactive filtering and visual storytelling using KPI cards, bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify key risk factors associated with heart disease
- Analyze patient demographics and medical attributes
- Detect high-risk patient segments
- Create an interactive healthcare analytics dashboard

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Power BI

## 🔎 Analysis Process

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Removed inconsistencies
- Standardized medical fields
- Handled missing values
- Transformed columns using Power Query

### 2️⃣ Data Modeling
- Created relationships between patient attributes
- Structured model for efficient reporting

### 3️⃣ DAX Measures Created
- Heart Disease Percentage
- High-Risk Patient Count
- Average Cholesterol by Age
- Diagnosis Distribution

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- KPI cards for total patients and diagnosis rate
- Gender-based disease comparison
- Chest pain type distribution
- Cholesterol & BP risk segmentation
- Age vs cholesterol trend analysis
- Interactive slicers for dynamic filtering

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- 51% of patients were diagnosed with heart disease.
- Males showed significantly higher disease rates than females.
- Patients reporting Typical Angina had higher diagnosis probability.
- Patients with cholesterol > 240 mg/dl and BP > 140 mm Hg were high risk.
- Cholesterol and heart rate levels increased with age.

---

## 🔬 Patterns & Relationships

- Strong positive correlation between age and cholesterol.
- Certain chest pain types align closely with higher diagnosis rates.
- Combination of high BP and high cholesterol increases risk probability.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Encourage early screening for middle-aged and senior males.
- Closely monitor patients with elevated cholesterol and BP.
- Use dashboards in clinical settings to support faster decision-making.
- Integrate predictive models for automated risk detection.
